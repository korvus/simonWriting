SimonWriting
============

Hand writing font of Korvus
---------------------------

### What is it?

SimonWriting is my personal font I use for my comics strip... or more if need!
I planed it for main latins alphabet, including French, Polish, Swedish, Czech, Spanish, Danish, German or Romanian.
Missing some of them, like Lituanian or Turquish.

### How it looks like?

Download and take a look at test.html on your favorite browser, firefox. It contains pangrams of main languages I quoted above.
